# Patch_Cura
 This Repo is a patch for Cura users to update all Tronxy profiles, while waiting for the updates to be included in an official Cura release.

There has been some special work put into this patch, which includes major improvements to print quality, removal of speed limitations, as well as the addition of dual extrusion support. Support has been added for multiple machines, including byt not limited to the new D01 Plus, and XY-3 Pro V2.

To install, download the complete .zip from https://github.com/64bittuning/Patch_Cura/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
Extract this .zip file to your desktop. Copy the "resources" folder and navigate through Windows file explorer to your Ultimaker Cura file folder (typically C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura xxxxx). Drag and drop the entire resources folder into the Ultimaker Cura folder. Allow windows to over-write ALL FILES. Close Cura if it is open, then restart the program. You MAY have to reset existing print profiles in order to see the maximum benefit from this update.

VzBot Users: A new mesh for the bed surface has been loaded, this is under the Tronxy X5SA printer profile. This will also be included in the next release, however it will need to be manually activated.
